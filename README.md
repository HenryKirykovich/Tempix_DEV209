# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

Just follow these simple steps:

1. Install the gh-pages package (ctrl+~ to open the terminal in VS Code)
npm install gh-pages --save-dev
2. In the package.json file add these lines before "build": "vite build",
"predeploy": "npm run build",
"deploy": "gh-pages -d dist",
3. In the vite.config.js file add this line before plugins: [react()],
base: "/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME",
Change YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME to the name of your GitHub repository.

4. In terminal type
npm run deploy
ðŸŽ‰ You now have a gh-pages branch in your repository and your app is deployed (you can check it under Settings -> Pages )

P.S. To update your app deployment, just run the npm run deploy command again.
